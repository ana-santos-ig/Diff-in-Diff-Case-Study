# Diff-in-Diff-Case-Study
Take-home case study analyzing the impact of a first-purchase discount using a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) causal inference approach.

📌 Overview
This project aims to evaluate the causal impact of a 15% discount on first-time purchases of class packs.
We use a Difference-in-Differences (Diff-in-Diff) approach to compare Test vs Control groups across Pre and Post periods in order to estimate the incremental effect of the discount on funnel performance.

Types of Analysis Performed:

Causal analysis using Difference-in-Differences
Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Funnel analysis (Views → Purchases → Conversion)

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

Pack Views
Purchases
Conversion Rate
